# Capstone 2 Project - Orange Booking

## Online hotel searching and booking website using content API

I am developing a hotel booking website named "OrangeBooking" using React in the frontend and Node.js in the backend. This website will allow users to search for and book hotel rooms at various destinations around the world, by using content API.

I use node.js to build backend and deploy on Heroku, and use react to build front and deploy to Surge, then connect them together.

How to access to the website

- download the repository
- open terminal, cd to repository folder, then cd to "client"
- at terminal, enter "npm install â€“global surge"
- once installed, enter "npm run build"
- once completed, cd to "build"
- enter "npx surge"
- as you login to surge, make sure change the domain name to "https://orange-booking-kenli.surge.sh/"

As a software developer, I am developing a hotel booking website named "OrangeBooking" using React in the frontend and Node.js in the backend. This website will allow users to search for and book hotel rooms at various destinations around the world.

To build the backend, I am using the Node.js framework, which allows me to write server-side code in JavaScript. I am also using Nodemon, a tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server whenever changes are made to the code. This helps to streamline the development process and allows me to quickly test and debug my code.

Once the backend is complete, I plan to deploy it to Heroku, a cloud-based platform that allows me to easily host and scale web applications. Heroku provides a simple and efficient way to deploy Node.js applications, and it includes a number of useful features such as automatic scaling, easy database integration, and built-in monitoring tools.

In the frontend, I am using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows me to create reusable UI components and provides a fast and efficient way to update the user interface in response to user input.

To deploy the frontend, I plan to use Surge, a simple static web publishing platform that allows me to deploy my React app to the web quickly and easily. Once the frontend is deployed, I will use the API provided by the backend to connect the two components together, enabling users to search for and book hotel rooms in real-time.

Overall, my use of React in the frontend and Node.js in the backend, along with the use of Nodemon, Heroku, and Surge for deployment and hosting, demonstrate my expertise in modern web development technologies. By using these tools together, I am able to create a powerful and scalable hotel booking website that provides a seamless user experience and helps users find and book hotel rooms around the world.
